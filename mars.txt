Cold and dry, but evertthing is my favourite colour. Need to find water, Atmospheric elements may be a problem
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman.
But the mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity. Need to find out the exact humidity, it might be too low for me and Wolfman. How will we recycle water? On the other hand may be we can just send Mummy there by themselves.
